3. **Test in CLion** - run your program and see if it works
4. **If stuck**, ask me for hints or step-by-step help
5. **Once working**, try to improve it or add features

## ðŸ’» **Quick CLion Setup Reminder**:

- **New file**: File â†’ New â†’ C++ Source File
- **Always start with**:

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>#include <string>  // if using stringsusing namespace std;int main() {    // Your code here    return 0;}
