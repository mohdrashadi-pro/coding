```
Enter a number: 3
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9

## 🟠 **Medium Exercises** (More Challenging!)

### Exercise 7: Number Guessing Game
**Task**: Computer picks a secret number (1-10). User keeps guessing until correct.

**Requirements**:
- Give hints: "Too high!" or "Too low!"
- Count number of attempts
- Congratulate when they guess correctly

**Expected Output**:
```
I'm thinking of a number between 1-10...
Enter your guess: 5
Too high! Try again: 3
Too low! Try again: 4
Correct! You got it in 3 attempts!
```

**Hint**: Use a `while` loop with `!=` condition. Set secret number like `int secret = 7;`

---

### Exercise 8: Sum Calculator
**Task**: Ask user for numbers continuously until they enter 0, then show the total sum.

**Expected Output**:
```
Enter numbers (0 to stop):
Enter number: 10
Enter number: 20
Enter number: 5
Enter number: 0
Total sum: 35
```

**Hint**: Use a `while` loop that continues while input `!= 0`. Add each number to a sum variable.

---

### Exercise 9: Menu System
**Task**: Create a simple calculator menu that keeps running until user chooses to exit.

**Menu Options**:
- 1: Add two numbers
- 2: Subtract two numbers
- 3: Multiply two numbers
- 4: Exit

**Expected Output**:
```
=== CALCULATOR MENU ===
1. Add
2. Subtract  
3. Multiply
4. Exit
Choose option: 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15

Choose option: 4
Goodbye!
```

**Hint**: Use a `do-while` loop with a `switch` statement or multiple `if-else`.

## 🔥 **Challenging Exercises** (Test Your Skills!)

### Exercise 10: Prime Number Checker
**Task**: Ask for a number and check if it's prime (only divisible by 1 and itself).

**Expected Output**:
```
Enter a number: 17
17 is a prime number.

Enter a number: 15
15 is not prime. (divisible by 3, 5)
```

**Hint**: Use a `for` loop to check if any number from 2 to (number-1) divides evenly. If none do, it's prime.

---

### Exercise 11: Countdown Timer
**Task**: Ask for starting number and count down to 1, then say "Blast off!"

**Requirements**:
- Count down every second (or just show numbers)
- Skip any number divisible by 3

9
8
7
5  (skipped 6)
4
2  (skipped 3)
1

## 📝 **How to Practice:**

1. **Pick any exercise** that interests you
2. **Start coding** - don't worry about perfection
3. **Test your program** with different inputs
4. **If stuck**, ask for hints: "Help me with Exercise 7"
5. **Once working**, try to improve or add features

## 💻 **Quick Setup Reminder:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>  // if using strings
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}
```

**Which exercise looks interesting to you?**

You can say things like:
- "I want to try Exercise 5"
- "Help me with the guessing game"
- "Show me the solution for Exercise 2"
- "Give me a hint for the prime number checker"

**Remember**: Start with what feels comfortable, then gradually try harder ones. Every programmer started exactly where you are now! 🚀

The key is to **practice regularly** - even 15 minutes a day makes a huge difference!
