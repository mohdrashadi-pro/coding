## **Problem-Solving Practice Session**

### **üî• Problem 1: The Birthday Calculator (Easy)**

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program that asks for someone's birth year and calculates:

1. Their current age
2. How many days they've been alive (approximately)
3. In what year they'll turn 100

---

### **Let's Solve This Together Using IDEAL:**

**üéØ STEP 1: IDENTIFY**

- **Input:** Birth year (integer)
- **Output:** Current age, days alive, year they turn 100
- **Current year:** 2025 (we need this for calculations)

**üéØ STEP 2: DESIGN**
Breaking it down:

1. Get birth year from user
2. Calculate age = current year - birth year
3. Calculate days = age √ó 365 (approximate)
4. Calculate year they turn 100 = birth year + 100
5. Display all results nicely

Variables needed:

- `int birthYear` - user input
- `int currentYear = 2025` - constant
- `int age` - calculated
- `int daysAlive` - calculated
- `int year100` - calculated

**üéØ STEP 3: EXAMPLE**
Let's trace through with birth year 1995:

- Age = 2025 - 1995 = 30 years old
- Days alive = 30 √ó 365 = 10,950 days
- Year turn 100 = 1995 + 100 = 2095

**üéØ STEP 4: ACTUAL CODE**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int birthYear;
    int currentYear = 2025;

    cout << "What year were you born? ";
    cin >> birthYear;

    int age = currentYear - birthYear;
    int daysAlive = age * 365;
    int year100 = birthYear + 100;

    cout << "\n=== Your Life Stats ===" << endl;
    cout << "Current age: " << age << " years old" << endl;
    cout << "Days alive: approximately " << daysAlive << " days" << endl;
    cout << "You'll turn 100 in the year: " << year100 << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

**üéØ STEP 5: LOOK BACK**

- Test with different years (1990, 2000, 2005)
- What if someone enters future year? (We'd get negative age!)
- Could add input validation later

### **üî• Problem 2: The Grade Calculator (Medium)**

**Problem Statement:**
A teacher wants a program that:

1. Asks for 5 test scores (0-100)
2. Calculates the average
3. Drops the lowest score and recalculates average
4. Assigns letter grade (A: 90+, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: below 60)
5. Shows improvement from original average

**Your Turn! Apply IDEAL method:**

**üéØ STEP 1: IDENTIFY (You fill this in!)**

- Input: ?
- Output: ?
- Rules/Constraints: ?

<details>
<summary>Click to see my analysis</summary>

- **Input:** 5 test scores (integers 0-100)
- **Output:** Original average, new average after dropping lowest, letter grade, improvement amount
- **Rules:** Drop exactly 1 lowest score, letter grades have specific ranges

</details>

**üéØ STEP 2: DESIGN (Your turn!)**
What steps do you need? What variables?

<details>
<summary>Click to see my design</summary>

**Steps:**

1. Get 5 scores from user
2. Calculate original average
3. Find the lowest score
4. Calculate new average without lowest score
5. Convert average to letter grade
6. Calculate improvement
7. Display all results

**Variables:**

- `int score1, score2, score3, score4, score5` (or array)
- `double originalAvg, newAvg`
- `int lowest`
- `char letterGrade`
- `double improvement`

</details>

**üéØ STEP 3: EXAMPLE (Try this yourself!)**
Pick 5 sample scores and walk through the logic.

<details>
<summary>My example with scores: 85, 92, 78, 95, 70</summary>

- Original average = (85+92+78+95+70)/5 = 420/5 = 84
- Lowest score = 70
- New average = (85+92+78+95)/4 = 350/4 = 87.5
- Letter grade = B (87.5 is in 80-89 range)
- Improvement = 87.5 - 84 = 3.5 points

</details>

**üéØ STEP 4: CODE IT!**
Try writing the code yourself using the design above.

<details>
<summary>See my solution</summary>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int scores[5];
    int sum = 0;

    // Get 5 scores
    cout << "Enter 5 test scores (0-100):" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << "Score " << (i + 1) << ": ";
        cin >> scores[i];
        sum += scores[i];
    }

    // Calculate original average
    double originalAvg = double(sum) / 5;

    // Find lowest score
    int lowest = scores[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
        if (scores[i] < lowest) {
            lowest = scores[i];
        }
    }

    // Calculate new average without lowest
    double newAvg = double(sum - lowest) / 4;

    // Determine letter grade
    char letterGrade;
    if (newAvg >= 90) letterGrade = 'A';
    else if (newAvg >= 80) letterGrade = 'B';
    else if (newAvg >= 70) letterGrade = 'C';
    else if (newAvg >= 60) letterGrade = 'D';
    else letterGrade = 'F';

    // Calculate improvement
    double improvement = newAvg - originalAvg;

    // Display results
    cout << "\n=== Grade Report ===" << endl;
    cout << "Original average: " << originalAvg << endl;
    cout << "Lowest score dropped: " << lowest << endl;
    cout << "New average: " << newAvg << endl;
    cout << "Letter grade: " << letterGrade << endl;
    cout << "Improvement: " << improvement << " points" << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

### **üî• Problem 3: The Password Strength Checker (Hard)**

**Problem Statement:**
Create a program that checks password strength based on these rules:

- **Weak:** Less than 8 characters
- **Medium:** 8+ characters AND (has numbers OR has uppercase)
- **Strong:** 8+ characters AND has numbers AND has uppercase AND has special characters (!@#$%^&*)

The program should:

1. Ask for a password
2. Check each criterion
3. Give specific feedback on what's missing
4. Rate the overall strength

**üéØ Challenge: Solve this completely on your own using IDEAL!**

**Hints for the tricky parts:**

- To check if character is uppercase: `(ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z')`
- To check if character is digit: `(ch >= '0' && ch <= '9')`
- To check special characters: `(ch == '!' || ch == '@' || ch == '#' || ...)`
- Use a loop to go through each character in the password

**Write your IDEAL analysis first, then code it!**

<details>
<summary>See my complete solution after you try</summary>

**IDEAL Analysis:**

**IDENTIFY:**

- Input: Password string
- Output: Strength level + specific feedback
- Rules: Length, uppercase, numbers, special chars

**DESIGN:**

1. Get password from user
2. Check length ‚â• 8
3. Loop through each character and count:
    - Uppercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Special characters
4. Apply strength rules
5. Give specific feedback

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string password;

    cout << "Enter a password to check its strength: ";
    cin >> password;

    // Check criteria
    bool hasMinLength = password.length() >= 8;
    bool hasUpper = false;
    bool hasNumber = false;
    bool hasSpecial = false;

    // Check each character
    for (int i = 0; i < password.length(); i++) {
        char ch = password[i];

        if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') {
            hasUpper = true;
        }
        else if (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9') {
            hasNumber = true;
        }
        else if (ch == '!' || ch == '@' || ch == '#' || ch == '$' ||
                 ch == '%' || ch == '^' || ch == '&' || ch == '*') {
            hasSpecial = true;
        }
    }

    // Determine strength
    string strength;
    if (!hasMinLength) {
        strength = "WEAK";
    }
    else if (hasUpper && hasNumber && hasSpecial) {
        strength = "STRONG";
    }
    else if (hasNumber || hasUpper) {
        strength = "MEDIUM";
    }
    else {
        strength = "WEAK";
    }

    // Display results
    cout << "\n=== Password Analysis ===" << endl;
    cout << "Password: " << password << endl;
    cout << "Length: " << password.length() << " characters" << endl;
    cout << "Strength: " << strength << endl;

    cout << "\nCriteria Check:" << endl;
    cout << "‚úì 8+ characters: " << (hasMinLength ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
    cout << "‚úì Has uppercase: " << (hasUpper ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
    cout << "‚úì Has numbers: " << (hasNumber ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
    cout << "‚úì Has special chars: " << (hasSpecial ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;

    // Specific feedback
    cout << "\nRecommendations:" << endl;
    if (!hasMinLength) cout << "- Make it at least 8 characters long" << endl;
    if (!hasUpper) cout << "- Add some uppercase letters (A-Z)" << endl;
    if (!hasNumber) cout << "- Add some numbers (0-9)" << endl;
    if (!hasSpecial) cout << "- Add special characters (!@#$%^&*)" << endl;

    if (strength == "STRONG") {
        cout << "- Great job! Your password is strong! üéâ" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

## **üéØ Problem-Solving Tips & Tricks**

### **When You Get Stuck:**

1. **Go back to IDENTIFY**
    - Re-read the problem carefully
    - Write down exactly what you know
    - Write down exactly what you need to find
2. **Simplify the problem**
    - Start with the easiest version
    - Get that working first
    - Then add complexity
3. **Use concrete examples**
    - Pick actual numbers and trace through by hand
    - Make sure your logic works on paper first
4. **Break it into tiny pieces**
    - Don't try to solve everything at once
    - Write one small part, test it, then move on
5. **Draw it out**
    - Use flowcharts, diagrams, or simple drawings
    - Visual thinking often helps

### **Common Problem-Solving Patterns:**

### **Pattern 1: Input ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Output**

Most programs follow this basic flow.

```cpp
// Get data
cout << "Enter number: ";
cin >> number;

// Process data
result = number * 2 + 1;

// Show result
cout << "Answer: " << result;

```

### **Pattern 2: Accumulator (Running Total)**

When you need to add things up or count.

```cpp
int sum = 0;  // Start with 0
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    sum += i;  // Keep adding to sum
}

```

### **Pattern 3: Find the Best (Min/Max)**

When looking for highest, lowest, best, etc.

```cpp
int highest = array[0];  // Start with first item
for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
    if (array[i] > highest) {
        highest = array[i];  // Found a better one!
    }
}

```

### **Pattern 4: Flag/Sentinel**

When checking if something was found or happened.

```cpp
bool found = false;
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (array[i] == target) {
        found = true;
        break;
    }
}

```
