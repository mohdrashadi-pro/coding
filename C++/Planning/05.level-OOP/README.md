## üîß CLion Setup

### Running Code in CLion:
1. **Create New File**: Right-click project ‚Üí New ‚Üí C++ Source File
2. **Run**: Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button or `Ctrl+R` (Mac: `Cmd+R`)
3. **Debug**: Click üêõ button or `Ctrl+D` (Mac: `Cmd+D`)

### Mac Terminal Commands:
```bash
# Compile and run
g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o program && ./program

# For debugging
g++ -std=c++17 -g filename.cpp -o program && ./program
```

## üìñ Week 6: Structures

### What is a Structure?
A `struct` groups related variables together under one name. Think of it as a container for related data.

### Key Concepts:
- **Member variables**: Variables inside the struct
- **Dot operator (.)**: Used to access members
- **Initialization**: Setting initial values
- **Arrays of structs**: Multiple objects of same type

### Simple Example:
```cpp
struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    double gpa;
};

Student s1;  // Create a student object
s1.name = "John";  // Access member with dot operator
```

### Daily Practice (Week 6):
- Day 1: Create basic struct
- Day 2: Initialize struct members
- Day 3: Arrays of structs
- Day 4: Functions with structs
- Day 5: Mini project - Person database

---

## üìñ Week 7: Basic Classes

### Class vs Struct:
- **struct**: Members are public by default
- **class**: Members are private by default
- Both can have functions, constructors, etc.

### Key Concepts:
- **Private**: Only the class itself can access
- **Public**: Anyone can access
- **Member functions**: Functions inside the class
- **Constructor**: Special function that runs when object is created

### Simple Example:
```cpp
class Rectangle {
private:
    double width, height;  // Private data
    
public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) {  // Constructor
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }
    
    double getArea() {  // Public function
        return width * height;
    }
};
```

### Daily Practice (Week 7):
- Day 1: Convert struct to class
- Day 2: Private vs public practice
- Day 3: Simple member functions
- Day 4: Basic constructors
- Day 5: Mini project - Calculator class

## üìñ Week 8: Encapsulation

### What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means hiding the internal details and only showing what's necessary. It's like a TV remote - you don't need to know how it works inside, just which buttons to press.

### Key Concepts:
- **Data hiding**: Keep data private
- **Getters**: Functions to read private data
- **Setters**: Functions to modify private data safely
- **Validation**: Check data before storing it

### Simple Example:
```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;  // Hidden from outside
    
public:
    // Getter - safe way to read balance
    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    
    // Setter - safe way to change balance
    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {  // Validation
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
};
```

### Daily Practice (Week 8):
- Day 1: Create getters and setters
- Day 2: Add input validation
- Day 3: Design a complete class
- Day 4: Multiple objects practice
- Day 5: Mini project - Student grade manager

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. **Forgetting Access Specifiers**
```cpp
// Wrong
class MyClass {
    int data;  // This is private! Can't access from outside
};

// Correct
class MyClass {
public:
    int data;  // Now it's accessible
};
```

### 2. **Not Using Constructors**
```cpp
// Wrong - uninitialized data
class Rectangle {
private:
    double width, height;  // Random values!
};

// Correct - always initialize
class Rectangle {
private:
    double width, height;
public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {}
};
```

### 3. **Direct Access to Private Data**
```cpp
// Wrong
class Person {
private:
    int age;
};
Person p;
p.age = 25;  // Error! Can't access private member

// Correct
class Person {
private:
    int age;
public:
    void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
    int getAge() { return age; }
};
```

## üìù Quick Reference

### Struct Syntax:
```cpp
struct StructName {
    datatype member1;
    datatype member2;
};
```

### Class Syntax:
```cpp
class ClassName {
private:
    // Private members
public:
    // Constructor
    ClassName(parameters);
    // Public functions
    returnType functionName();
};
```

### Object Creation:
```cpp
ClassName objectName(parameters);  // With constructor
ClassName objectName;              // Default constructor
```

### Accessing Members:
```cpp
objectName.publicMember;
objectName.publicFunction();
```

## üÜò Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. **Read error messages carefully** - they tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check access specifiers** - is your member public or private?
3. **Verify object creation** - did you call the constructor correctly?
4. **Ask for help** - explain what you expected vs what happened

Remember: Object-Oriented Programming is a new way of thinking. Take your time and practice with small examples first!
