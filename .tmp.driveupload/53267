SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 1;  -- only employee with ID = 1

SELECT * 
FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name ASC;  -- sort by last name ascending

-- 5. Limit number of rows
SELECT * 
FROM employees
LIMIT 3;  -- return first 3 rows

-- 6. Aggregate functions
SELECT AVG(hourly_pay) AS avg_pay,
       SUM(hourly_pay) AS total_pay,
       COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
       MIN(hourly_pay) AS min_pay,
       MAX(hourly_pay) AS max_pay
FROM employees;

-- 7. Grouping
SELECT hourly_pay, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY hourly_pay;

-- 8. Distinct values
SELECT DISTINCT hourly_pay
FROM employees;

-- 9. Multiple conditions with AND/OR
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE hourly_pay > 15 AND hire_date > '2024-01-01';

-- 10. Pattern matching with LIKE
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%';  -- names starting with 'A'

-- 11. Using IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
SELECT *
