# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a C++ project repository that is currently empty but set up for development. The project appears to be structured for small C++ exercises or projects.

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── small-project/    # Main project directory (currently empty)
└── WARP.md          # This file
```

## Development Setup

This project is ready for C++ development. Common setup steps would include:

1. Create source files in the `small-project/` directory
2. Add a build system (CMake, Makefile, or similar)
3. Set up testing framework if needed

## Common Commands

Since this is a C++ project template, here are typical commands that would be used once the project is populated:

### Building (when CMake is added):
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Building (when Makefile is added):
```bash
make
```

### Running (typical for C++ projects):
```bash
./build/project_name
# or
./small-project/executable_name
```

### Cleaning:
```bash
make clean
# or
rm -rf build/
```

## Notes for Future Development

- This repository is currently empty and ready for C++ project initialization
- Consider adding a CMakeLists.txt or Makefile for build configuration
- Add a README.md to document the specific project purpose
- Set up appropriate compiler flags for the project requirements
- Consider adding a .gitignore file for C++ build artifacts
